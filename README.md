# PermutationsOfShorterInLongerString

Given a smaller string s and a bigger string b, design an algorithm to find all permutations of the shorter string within the longer one.
 
Print the location of each permutations.
 
### Example:

```
s="abbc"

b="cbabadcbbabbcbabaabccbabc"
```

We get ```7 permutations``` from the above example.

```
From index 0 to index 3

From index 6 to index 9

From index 9 to index 12

From index 11 to index 14

From index 12 to index 15

From index 20 to index 23

From index 21 to index 24
```
